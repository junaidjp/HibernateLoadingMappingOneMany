The <list> element is used to set 
the relationship between Account and Customer classes. 
We used the cascade attribute in the <list>
 element to tell Hibernate to persist the Account objects at the same time as the 
 Customer objects. 
 The name attribute is set to the defined List 
 variable in the parent class, in our case it is account.



The <key> element is the column in the Account 
table that holds the foreign key to the parent object ie. table Customer.





The <list-index> element is used to keep the position of the element 
and map with the index column in the collection table. 
The index of the persistent list starts at zero. 
You could change this, for example, with <list-index base="1".../> in your mapping.


The <one-to-many> element 
indicates that one 
Customer object relates to many 
Account objects and, as such, the 
Account object must have a 
Customer parent associated with it. 
You can use either
 <one-to-one>, <many-to-one> or 
 <many-to-many> elements based on your requirement. 
 If we changed this example to use a many-to-many relationship, 
 we would need an association table to map between the parent and the child objects.
